### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jose Manuel, an enthusiastic Electronic Engineer ðŸ”‹ðŸ”‹ keen interest in the transformative potential of signal processing ðŸŒŠ, machine learning, and artificial intelligence âœ¨âœ¨ (AI) in healthcare ðŸ’ŠðŸ’Š. 
I have been particularly drawn to how these technologies can be applied to healthcare to enhance diagnostics, improve patient outcomes, and innovate treatment strategies.
As I prepare to apply for my PhD program in Electrical Engineering âš¡âš¡, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to groundbreaking research in these fields. 

âœ¨Thank you for exploring my profile. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to the vibrant research community! âœ¨

- ðŸ‘” I'm currently working at the [Stepp Lab for Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Engineering](https://sites.bu.edu/stepplab/) as a Research Fellow.
